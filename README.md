# Power-bi-Project-Data-professional-survey-

In this project I used a realtime survey report by total of 630 anaonymos people from all over the world 
Questions 
1.Average salary by job title 

2.Happiness with current salary (rating) 

3.work/life balance (rating )

4.Favorite programing language by job title 

5.Survey takers by country 

I used power query to clean up some data like removing unnecessary columns and using DAX formlas for better data and creating new columns
